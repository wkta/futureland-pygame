# futureland: the game

## pre-requisites
+ Python 3.5.2 (recommanded)
+ pygame 1.9.6 or higher
+ [the coremon_engine](https://github.com/wkta/coremon_engine)

## basic game concept
What's the deal?

This repo contains a game prototype fully coded in Python+pygame.

The whole idea behind "futureland" is to give the player the opportunity to explore
a **boundary-less** 2d open-world,
with full freedom to move, along with the ability to build an arbitrary number of structures.
So one can stumble upon them again later.
